In this notebook, pandas is used to examine 2018 lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Then, we will calculate

the total number of strikes for each month and plot this information on a bar graph.
date string manipulations in Python and use it to calculate the quarterly lightning strike totals and plot them on bar graphs.
Find the locations with the greatest number of strikes within a single day
Examine the locations that had the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike
Determine whether certain days of the week had more lightning strikes than others
Add data from 2016 and 2017 and, for each month, calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for that year that occurred in that month
Plot this data on a bar graph
