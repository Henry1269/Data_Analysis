**Overview - basic data functions**

In this notebook, pandas are used to examine 2018 lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This notebook takes one through the EDA- using basic data functions with Python, EDA- structuring with Python, and dealing with missing values and outliers with Python. Then, the following calculations will be done to implement the processes listed above.

- The total number of strikes for each month and plot this information on a bar graph.
- Date string manipulations in Python and use it to calculate the quarterly lightning strike totals and plot them on bar graphs.
- Find the locations with the greatest number of strikes within a single day
- Examine the locations that had the greatest number of days with at least one lightning strike
- Determine whether certain days of the week had more lightning strikes than others
- Add data from 2016 and 2017 and, for each month, calculate the percentage of total lightning strikes for that year that occurred in that month
- Plot this data on a bar graph
- **Dealing with outliers and missing data.**
- **Label encoding for categorical variables.**
- **Input Validation of columns**
