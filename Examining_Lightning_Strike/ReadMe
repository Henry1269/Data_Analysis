In this notebook, we will use pandas to examine 2018 lightning strike data collected by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). Then, we will calculate 
- the total number of strikes for each month and plot this information on a bar graph.
- date string manipulations in Python and use it to calculate the quarterly lightning strike totals and plot them on bar graphs.
