In this project, some statistical processes in data analysis will be implemented on an Educational Dataset. The research was to find the districts where there is low literacy so that the government can apportion educational resources to those districts. During this project, the following statistical processes were implemented;
- Descriptive Statistics
- Probability Distributions
- Sampling
- Confidence Intervals
- Hypothesis Testing. 

The data dictionary can be found [here](https://github.com/Henry1269/Data_Analysis/assets/93161307/48fb1f9a-2677-46d5-b73e-b597be62499b)
